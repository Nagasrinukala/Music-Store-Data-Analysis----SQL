# Music-Store-Data-Analysis----SQL
This project presents a comprehensive SQL database designed for a music store. It covers essential entities and relationships needed to manage music inventory, sales, customers, employees, and business insights. The database includes tables for genres, media types, artists, albums, tracks, customers, employees, invoices, invoice lines, and playlists.

Through carefully crafted SQL queries, the project solves real-world business questions, such as identifying top customers, best-selling genres, and popular artists, making it a practical foundation for analytics and decision-making in the music retail industry.

This project demonstrates how SQL empowers us to transform raw music store data into actionable business insights. By designing and querying a relational database, we can accurately identify which cities generate the most revenue, which customers are our top spenders, and which genres and artists are most popular.
